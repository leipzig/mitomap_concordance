The MITOMAP Concordance
===================
MITOMAP conducts periodic analysis of all full length (>15.4kbp) mitochondrial sequences in GenBank. This involves processing the nearly 30k sequences through MITOMASTER. While no means an unbiased survey, the GenBank set offers some interesting opportunities to study human mitochondrial variability.

This is a whirlwind tour through the exiting world of mitochondrial mutations
